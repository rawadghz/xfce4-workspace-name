# xfce4 workspace name widget

a configurable xfce4 workspace name widget written in tcl and bash

## installation

- update directory path (absolute) to point to installation directory:
    - `run.sh`
    - `var_path` in `workspace_name_widget.tcl`
- add `/path/to/installation/directory/run.sh` to _application autostart_ within _xfce4 session and startup_ settings

## TODO

- [ ] comment the code
- [ ] fix paths to work relatively rather than by absolute path
